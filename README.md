# cryptography
Linear algebra can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. A simple example is the Hill cipher. Explain how the
Hill cipher works and how linear algebra is involved in encryption and decryption. You will also need to include a
brief explanation of modular arithemetic, which is needed to understand how the Hill cipher works. Write a simple
MATLAB code that implements encryption and decryption using the Hill cipher.
